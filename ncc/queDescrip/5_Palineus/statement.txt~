Sagar Bought a new Laptop whose Processor works on a Address space of length N and each element of address can take a value from 0 to m-1 inclusive.
Tejas has made a new virus named Palineus ,this Virus Corrupts all palindromic addresses, and he has injected this virus in Sagar's laptop. Sagar wants to know number of uncorrupted addresses.
Help Sagar in finding the no. of uncorrupted Addresses.

Input:-
	First Line is T denoting no. of test cases
	first line of each test contains two space seperated integers N and M.
	
Output:-
	for each test case print a single integer denoting no. of uncorrupted addresses (modulo 1000000007).
	
Constraints:-
	1<=T<=100
	1<=N,M<=1000000000000
	
Sample input:-
	1
	3 2
	
Sample Output:-
	4
	
Explanaton:-
	All possible addresses of length 3 where M=2, are
	000
	001
	010
	011
	100
	101
	110
	111
	
	Address that are not Palindrome are
	001
	011
	100
	110
	so answer is 4.
