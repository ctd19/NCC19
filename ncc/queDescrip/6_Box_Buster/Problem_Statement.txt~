 Now, a small mailbox manufacturer is interested
in how many fire-crackers his new mailbox prototype can withstand
without exploding and has hired you to help him. He will provide you
with k (1 <= k <= 10) identical mailbox prototypes each fitting up to
m (1 <= m <= 100) crackers. However, he is not sure of how many firecrackers
he needs to provide you with in order for you to be able to solve
his problem. What is the minimum number of crackers that you
should ask him to provide you with?

You may assume the following:
1. If a mailbox can withstand x fire-crackers, it can also withstand x1
fire-crackers.

2. Upon an explosion, a mailbox is either totally destroyed (blown up)
or unharmed, which means that it can be reused in another test
explosion.

Input Format :
The input starts with a single integer N (1 <= N <= 10) indicating the
number of test cases to follow. 
Each test case is described by a line
containing two integers: k and m, separated by a single space.

Input Format :
For each test case print one line with a single integer indicating the
minimum number of fire-crackers that is needed

Sample Input :
4
1 10
1 100
3 73
5 100

Sample Output :
55
5050
382
495
