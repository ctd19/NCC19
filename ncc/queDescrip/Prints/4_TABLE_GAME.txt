TABLE GAME

Shivam's Casino is running fine. All thanks to people who did not use Wheel Of Fortune.[-.-] Very few people tested their luck on wheel of fortune. Fortunately for Shivam, this saved a lot of money. So he decided to install a new game, called 'Table Game' which is played on a table.

    Due to heavy cash prize on this game, and regret for not playing wheel of fortune, a lot of
people came to Shivam's casino to play 'Table Game'.

Because of heavy demand of Table Game, Shivam asked Akash to help him out.

    Akash implemented following strategy :
            1. A player plays 'Table Game' for exactly 'T' units of time.
            2. Every table can serve at most 'K' players at a time.
            3. No player should go un-attended, and should be served immediately.
            4. Suppose a player starts playing at x’th second then at (x+T)’th second he’ll be leaving the table. At (x+T)’th second he/she won’t be served by the table.

 But with 'N' number of players coming to casino to play at N(i) time (1<=i<=N),  Akash might need more than 1 table for his strategy to be a success.But Shivam wants to minimize his investment, and hence wants less number of tables
Each new table that will be added also can serve at most ‘K’ players at a time.

Print minimum number of tables required .
