Two mathematicians Darshan and Shubham are competing with each other.
To see who is superior amongst them they are planing to play a game called "The Stack Game".
The Stack Game is a simple game played with numbered blocks and a stack.
Shivang gives them N blocks having numbers printed on them.
Each player plays alternatively and adds a block to the top of the stack.
 
Rules of the game are very simple:

Initially the stack is empty.
If no blocks are in the stack, the player can select any block from the N given blocks and add it to the stack.
A player can add a block to the stack only if it is a factor of the block on the top.

The one who is not able to make any move loses the game.
Once a block is used it can't be used again.

Darshan starts the game.

Input Format:

First line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases.
First line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of blocks
Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers denoting the numbers written on blocks.

Output Format:

For each test, print "Darshan" if Darshan wins, "Shubham" if Shubham wins (without quotes) on new line.
